### Framework:
A framework is a framework or scheme of work generally used by programmers to perform software development. Using a framework allows you to streamline development processes as it avoids having to write code repetitively, ensures good practices and code consistency.

### Media Type: 
Media type is a format of a request or response body data. Web service operations can accept and return data in different formats, the most common being JSON, XML and images. You specify the media type in request and response definitions. Here is an example of a response definition:

### Nginx:
Nginx, pronounced like “engine-ex”, is an open-source web server that, since its initial success as a web server, is now also used as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer.

### Systemd:
systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.

### Proxy Server:
A proxy server is a computer system or router that functions as a relay between client and server. It helps prevent an attacker from invading a private network and is one of several tools used to build a firewall. The word proxy means "to act on behalf of another," and a proxy server acts on behalf of the user.

### Webserver:
The term web server can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.

1. On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.
2. On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.
